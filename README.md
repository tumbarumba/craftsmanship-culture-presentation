# Learning, Communication, and Craftsmanship

Culture is difficult to describe, but it has a huge impact on the successful adoption of new
techniques. What cultural factors allow successful change? This talk explores growth mindset,
mutual learning, communication patterns, and quality focus as enablers to the adoption of craftsmanship.
