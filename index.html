            Hi, I'm Joe. (picture me yawning at Robert Menzies College ball, or perhaps zombie Joe?)

            I'm going to start with a story.
            I was involved in a large departmental lean and agile transformation in a bank
            - the background: high tech debt, low autonomy, high attrition
            - the vision (monty python holy grail)
            - assembling the team (?)
            - I was focussing on XP practices
            - setting the goal

            "Software Craftsmanship is about professionalism in software development." Sandro Mancuso

            What happens when you work in an environment where you're not allowed to be "professional"?
            What if the prevailing idea of "professional" is something different and alien, and ugly?
            How do you change that?

            We'll touch upon themes. Learning, Growth Mindset, Committment to Quality, Professionalism.
            That is craftmanship. (Picture from Sandro's book cover)

            The fact that you're here in a software craftmanship conference shows that you are personally committed to Learning,
            Growth, Quality, Professionalism. But what about your co-workers, your management, your company as a whole? Do they
            support your journey?

            Productive Partnerships, one of the Software Craftmanship values.

            ... but some clients are not ready for a productive partnership.

            "there are still companies out there that are not ready for this type of partnership. They see software development
            as an industrial process and the least important part of the project. For some companies, software developers are
            the same as factory workers, who are there just to follow orders from smarter people" - Sandro

            This is a talk about culture. What is it? How do you influence it?
            This is a talk about mutual learning. How can you understand the business problems better.
            How can the business understand the craftmanship approach better?

            Culture

            What is culture?

            Culture is
            - whatever people learn from other people, and transmit to other people, especially by interacting with them.
            - Embodied culture is the things we don’t event need to think about (e.g. dribbling ball, singing anthem, attitudes to horse meat)
            - Values and goals that guide our actions
            - Habitus: many of our habits are acquired as part of the culture in which we are immersed

            Forces of culture
            - Intertial forces
                - existential inertia
                    - story about cutting the ends of the meat before roasting
                - habitual intertia
                    - accent and speaking
            - Entropic force
                - the tendency towards disorder in the transmission of culture
                - works against inertia
            - Reflective or metacultural forces:
                - metaculture is culture that is about (or reflects upon) other culture.
                - Metacultural force result from reflection about culture
            - The forces of interest: these are produced by the feelings and emotions.
                - they impel or retard the movement of cultural elements
                - a good leader understands the emotional responses to cultural elements, and uses this to affect change
                - Force of interest can either work to keep culture static, or it could drive culture to change. It’s at the heart
                    of successful culture change
                - Incremental new-ness can a positive attractive force. (e.g. new model of a car every year)

            The Secret to Successful Culture Change
            - the new culture must appear to grow organically out of the old culture.
            - It must be new enough to be recognisable as different, but also sufficiently similar that its relationship to the old culture can be sensed.
            - Feelings or affections can propel the motion of culture, or inhibit it. These feelings are hugely influential.

            Joshua Kerievsky: stop calling them "technical practices"
            https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-calling-them-technical-practices-joshua-kerievsky/
            Technical debt cripples many businesses. Engineers use practices like Refactoring to manage
            technical debt. So is Refactoring merely a technical concern, uncoupled to business matters? Not at all. Refactoring
            helps us produce better designs that enable businesses to build better customer solutions faster. Refactoring helps
            us keep a design simple so we can continue to code faster, rather than getting bogged down in complexity. Building
            better customer solutions and getting work done quickly are vital business concerns, not merely technical concerns.

            -- Notes

            Empty the cup (From Appenticeship Patterns)

            Andy Parker:
            - you can't change other people, you only have control over yourself.
            - ambivalence is essential

            Michael Feathers: make the reality of the software transparent to the organisation. Give the software a health score
            for "readiness to change" (from Software Engineering Radio)

            Jeff Frederick: explicit vision: "to be a highly effective organisation, we need to elevate learning", psychological safety

            Mentoring, external perspectives (Jason Gorman, Barry)

            Alistair Cockburn:
            - no company has successfully changed from Waterfall to agile
            - growth mindset: are there books, etc on peoples desks?
            - https://youtu.be/150OSyFUU_w?t=54m34s
              - Question was: "How do you get a large organisations to change a culture, where extending yourself beyond your job title is very high risk"
              - Answer was: I haven't heard of any success stories
              - Borland, 2006. Visited office where everyone was working in agile. How did you transform? We didn't, we
              opened a new building. We only invited people in with the right attitude. We don't try to convert people
              from "thinking A" to "thinking B"
              - Real Estate Australia story
                - 200 people were transformed in 2 years.
                - This was a "fast" transformation
                - Senior manager always says "sure", "yes". He let things happen
              - Alistair recalled going to a company, CTO asked him "how do I make people curious". He said "It's too
                late, you hired the wrong people"
              - 2 parts:
                - let them in the door (i.e. hire people with the right mindset)
                - just say yes all the time


            Lynn Runnels-Moss: communication patterns

            Andy: watch what people do, not what they say. E.g. craftsmanship is not focused on business outcomes

            Re: Your Brains
            The Zombies of Taylorism. We've known for years that theory x doesn't work for knowledge work.

            Metrics! What metrics? Are they the right ones? bah!


            Teal organisations go for the head shot of the senior management zombies


            Daniel Pink, Drive:
            - ROWE— a results-only work environment.
            - “For them, it’s all about craftsmanship . And they need a lot of autonomy.”
            - My dad’s generation views human beings as human resources. They’re the two-by-fours you need to build your house,” he says. “For me, it’s a partnership between me and the employees. They’re not resources. They’re partners.” And partners, like all of us, need to direct their own lives.

            Fixed mindset examples:
            - I'm not good with people
            - I'm just the technical person
            - I'm just the BA
